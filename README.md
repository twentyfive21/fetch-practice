# Learning Fetch Syntax 
---
## This repo provides resources to help you learn fetch syntax for making API requests in JavaScript.

## It contains exercises covering:
* Basic Fetch - Using the native fetch API to make a request and process the response.
* Async Fetch - Using async/await for cleaner async fetch code.
* Fetch with Axios - Making requests with the popular Axios library.
* Async Axios Fetch -  Using async/await for axios fetch. 
* Async Fetch with Auth - Adding authorization headers to fetch requests.
---
## For each exercise, I have provided a commented out code snippet that you can uncomment and run to see it in action.
## *** Important please read before starting ****
### Experiment with modifying the provided code to get hands-on practice with different syntax approaches. Please don't just uncomment my code and move on you won't learn from that. 
* First uncomment my code to see how it works and see what your supposed to return in the console.
* Then comment it out so you can type your fetch in the answer area. Yes my answers are there, but we are learning syntax and getting used to fetches so test things out! You learn from making mistakes! 
* This is good starter code for any fetches you will need to do. I can't stop you from copying this code into your projects, but you won't learn and can get into bugs that make no sense. So learn the syntax first and understand the basics and you will be such a better coder.

# Learning outcome : 
### You should come out of this practice comfortable with fetches and if not its okay keep practicing! This is here for anyone who needs it no matter how advanced you are.

## The exercises use the https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos API endpoint to fetch sample todo data. You can tweak the URL to return different sets of data. In my code I have /todos/1 to return the first object if you want all of the objects just use it without the /1. 


## Let me know if you have any other questions! Happy coding!
